!Classes and metaclasses
@cha:metaclasses

As we saw in Chapter *: The Pharo Object Model>../PharoObjectModel/PharoObjectModel.pier@cha:model*,
in Pharo, everything is an object, and every object is an instance of a class.
Classes are no exception: classes are objects, and class objects are instances
of other classes. This object model captures the essence of object-oriented
programming, and is lean, simple, elegant and uniform. However, the implications
of this uniformity may confuse newcomers. The goal of this chapter is to show
that there is nothing complex, ''magic'' or special here: just simple rules
applied uniformly. By following these rules you can always understand why the
situation is the way that it is.

!!Rules for classes and metaclasses

The Pharo object model is based on a limited number of concepts applied
uniformly. To refresh your memory, here are the rules of the object model that
we explored in
Chapter *: The Pharo Object Model>../PharoObjectModel/PharoObjectModel.pier@cha:model*.

; Rule 1
: Everything is an object.
; Rule 2
: Every object is an instance of a class.
; Rule 3
: Every class has a superclass.
; Rule 4
: Everything happens by sending messages.
; Rule 5
: Method lookup follows the inheritance chain.

As we mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, a consequence of Rule 1 is
that ''classes are objects too'', so Rule 2 tells us that classes must also be
instances of classes. The class of a class is called a ''metaclass''.

@sec:metaclassIntro

A metaclass is created automatically for you whenever you create a class. Most
of the time you do not need to care or think about metaclasses. However, every
time that you use the browser to browse the ''class side'' of a class, it is
helpful to recall that you are actually browsing a different class. A class and
its metaclass are two separate classes, even though the former is an instance of
the latter.

To properly explain classes and metaclasses, we need to extend the rules from
Chapter *: The Pharo Object Model>../PharoObjectModel/PharoObjectModel.pier@cha:model*
with the following additional rules.

; Rule 6
: Every class is an instance of a metaclass.
; Rule 7
: The metaclass hierarchy parallels the class hierarchy.
; Rule 8
: Every metaclass inherits from ==Class== and ==Behavior==.
; Rule 9
: Every metaclass is an instance of ==Metaclass==.
; Rule 10
: The metaclass of ==Metaclass== is an instance of ==Metaclass==.

Together, these 10 rules complete Pharo's object model.

We will first briefly revisit the 5 rules from
Chapter *: The Pharo Object Model>../PharoObjectModel/PharoObjectModel.pier@cha:model*
with a small example. Then we will take a closer look at the new rules, using
the same example.

!!Revisiting the Pharo object model

Since everything is an object, an ordered collection in Pharo is also an object.

[[[
OrderedCollection withAll: #(4 5 6 1 2 3)
	--> an OrderedCollection(4 5 6 1 2 3)
]]]

Every object is an instance of a class. The class of an ordered collection is
the class ==OrderedCollection==:

[[[
(OrderedCollection withAll: #(4 5 6 1 2 3)) class
	--> OrderedCollection
]]]

Interestingly, if we send the message ==asSortedCollection==, we get an instance
of a different class, namely ==SortedCollection==:

[[[
(OrderedCollection withAll: #(4 5 6 1 2 3)) asSortedCollection class
	--> SortedCollection
]]]

By Rule 3, every class has a superclass. The superclass of ==SortedCollection==
is ==OrderedCollection==, and the superclass of ==OrderedCollection== is
==SequenceableCollection==:

[[[
SortedCollection superclass --> OrderedCollection
OrderedCollection superclass --> SequenceableCollection
SequenceableCollection --> Collection
Collection --> Object
]]]

[[[
(OrderedCollection withAll: #(4 5 6 1 2 3)) at: 1
	--> 4
]]]

Everything happens by sending messagess (Rule 4), so we can deduce that
==withAll:== is a message to ==OrderedCollection==, ==class== and
==asSortedCollection== are messages sent to the ordered collection instance, and
==superclass== is a message to ==OrderedCollection== and ==SortedCollection==.
The receiver in each case is an object, since everything is an object, but some
of these objects are also classes.

Method lookup follows the inheritance chain (Rule 5), so when we send the
message ==class== to the result of ==(OrderedCollection withAll: #(4 5 6 1 2 3))
asSortedCollection==, the message is handled when the corresponding method is
found in the class ==Object==, as shown in Figure *@fig:classmessage*.

+Sending a message to a sorted collection>file://figures/SortedCollectionClassMessage.png|label=fig:classmessage+

The figure captures the essence of the ''is-a'' relationship. Our
sortedCollection object ''is a'' ==SortedCollection== instance, but we can also
say that it ''is a'' ==OrderedCollection== and that it ''is an'' ==Object==,
since it responds to the messages defined in all of these classes. In fact,
there is a message, ==isKindOf:==, that you can send to any object to find out
if it is in an ''is a'' relationship with a given class:

[[[
sortedCollection := (OrderedCollection withAll: #(4 5 6 1 2 3)) asSortedCollection.
sortedCollection isKindOf: SortedCollection --> true
sortedCollection isKindOf: OrderedCollection --> true
sortedCollection isKindOf: Object                  --> true
]]]

!!Every class is an instance of a metaclass

As we mentioned earlier in Section *@sec:metaclassIntro*, classes whose
instances are themselves classes are called metaclasses.

!!!!!Metaclasses are implicit.

Metaclasses are automatically created when you define a class. We say that they
are ''implicit'' since as a programmer you never have to worry about them. An
implicit metaclass is created for each class you create, so each metaclass has
only a single instance.

Whereas ordinary classes are named by global variables, metaclasses are
anonymous. However, we can always refer to them through the class that is their
instance. The class of ==SortedCollection==, for instance, is ==SortedCollection
class==, and the class of ==Object== is ==Object class==:

[[[
SortedCollection class   --> Color class
Object class --> Object class
]]]

Figure *@fig:translucentmetaclasses* shows how each class is an instance of its
(anonymous) metaclass. Note that we only skip ==SequenceableCollection==
and ==Collection== from the figures and explanation due to space constraints.
Their absence does not change the overall meaning.

+The metaclasses of ==SortedCollection== and its superclasses>file://figures/SortedCollectionMetaclasses.png|label=fig:translucentmetaclasses+

The fact that classes are also objects makes it easy for us to query them by
sending messages. Let's have a look:

[[[
OrderedCollection subclasses        --> {SortedCollection . ObjectFinalizerCollection . WeakOrderedCollection . OCLiteralList . GLMMultiValue}
SortedCollection subclasses         --> #()
SortedCollection allSuperclasses  --> an OrderedCollection(OrderedCollection SequenceableCollection Collection Object ProtoObject)
SortedCollection instVarNames     --> #('sortBlock')
SortedCollection allInstVarNames --> #('array' 'firstIndex' 'lastIndex' 'sortBlock')
SortedCollection selectors             -->  #(#indexForInserting: #sort:to: #addAll: #reSort #sortBlock: #copyEmpty #addFirst: #insert:before: #defaultSort:to: #median #at:put: #add: #= #collect: #flatCollect: #sort: #join: #sortBlock)
]]]

!!The metaclass hierarchy parallels the class hierarchy

Rule 7 says that the superclass of a metaclass cannot be an arbitrary class: it
is constrained to be the metaclass of the superclass of the metaclass's unique
instance.

[[[
SortedCollection class superclass --> OrderedCollection class
SortedCollection superclass class --> OrderedCollection class
]]]

This is what we mean by the metaclass hierarchy being parallel to the class
hierarchy. Figure *@fig:parallelHierarchies* shows how this works in the
==SortedCollection== hierarchy.

+The metaclass hierarchy parallels the class hierarchy.>file://figures/SortedCollectionMetaclassHierarchy.png|label=fig:parallelHierarchies+

[[[
SortedCollection class                                     --> SortedCollection class
SortedCollection class superclass                   --> OrderedCollection class
SortedCollection class superclass superclass --> SequenceableCollection class
SortedCollection class superclass superclass superclass superclass--> Object class
]]]

!!!!Uniformity between Classes and Objects

It is interesting to step back a moment and realize that there is no difference
between sending a message to an object and to a class. In both cases the search
for the corresponding method starts in the class of the receiver, and proceeds
up the inheritance chain.

Thus, messages sent to classes must follow the metaclass inheritance chain.
Consider, for example, the method ==withAll:==, which is implemented on the
class side of ==Collection==. If we send the message ==withAll:== to
==OrderedCollection==, then it will be looked up the same way as any other
message. The lookup starts in ==OrderedCollection class==, and proceeds up the
metaclass hierarchy until it is found in ==Collection class== (see Figure
*@fig:metaclasslookup*).

[[[
OrderedCollection withAll: #(4 5 6 1 2 3) --> an OrderedCollection (4 5 6 1 2 3)
]]]

Note that we get as a result an ordinary ==Color blue==, and not a translucent
one â€” there is no magic!

+Message lookup for classes is the same as for ordinary objects.>file://figures/InstanceMessage.png|label=fig:metaclasslookup+

Thus we see that there is one uniform kind of method lookup in Pharo. Classes
are just objects, and behave like any other objects. Classes have the power to
create new instances only because classes happen to respond to the message
==new==, and because the method for ==new== knows how to create new instances.
Normally, non-class objects do not understand this message, but if you have a
good reason to do so, there is nothing stopping you from adding a ==new== method
to a non-metaclass.

Since classes are objects, we can also inspect them.

Inspect ==OrderedCollection withAll: #(4 5 6 1 2 3)== and ==OrderedCollection==.

Notice that in one case you are inspecting an instance of ==OrderedCollection==
and in the other case the ==OrderedCollection== class itself. This can be a bit
confusing, because the title bar of the inspector names the ''class'' of the
object being inspected.

The inspector on ==OrderedCollection== allows you to see the superclass,
instance variables, method dictionary, and so on, of the ==OrderedCollection==
class, as shown in Figure *@fig:inspectingColor*.

+Classes are objects too.>file://figures/InspectingOrderedCollection.png|label=fig:inspectingColor+

!!Every metaclass Inherits from ==Class== and ==Behavior==

Every metaclass ''is-a'' class, hence inherits from ==Class==. ==Class== in turn
inherits from its superclasses, ==ClassDescription== and ==Behavior==. Since
everything in Pharo ''is-an'' object, these classes all inherit eventually from
==Object==. We can see the complete picture in Figure *@fig:inheritbehavior*.

+Metaclasses inherit from ==Class== and ==Behavior==>file://figures/SortedCollectionBehavior.png|label=fig:inheritbehavior+

!!!!Where is ==new== defined?

To understand the importance of the fact that metaclasses inherit from ==Class==
and ==Behavior==, it helps to ask where ==new== is defined and how it is found.
When the message ==new== is sent to a class, it is looked up in its metaclass
chain and ultimately in its superclasses ==Class==, ==ClassDescription== and
==Behavior== as shown in Figure *@fig:sendingnew*.

The question ''Where is ==new== defined?'' is crucial. ==new== is first
defined in the class ==Behavior==, and it can be redefined in its subclasses,
including any of the metaclass of the classes we define, when this is necessary.
Now when a message ==new== is sent to a class it is looked up, as usual, in the
metaclass of this class, continuing up the superclass chain right up to the
class ==Behavior==, if it has not been redefined along the way.

Note that the result of sending ==SortedCollection new== is an instance of
==SortedCollection== and ''not'' of ==Behavior==, even though the method is
looked up in the class ==Behavior==! ==new== always returns an instance of
==self==, the class that receives the message, even if it is implemented in
another class.

[[[
SortedCollection new class --> SortedCollection    "not Behavior!"
]]]

+==new== is an ordinary message looked up in the metaclass chain.>file://figures/SortedOrderedSendingNew.png|label=fig:sendingnew+

A common mistake is to look for ==new== in the superclass of the receiving
class. The same holds for ==new:==, the standard message to create an object of
a given size. For example, ==Array new: 4== creates an array of 4 elements. You
will not find this method defined in ==Array== or any of its superclasses.
Instead you should look in ==Array class== and its superclasses, since that is
where the lookup will start.

!!!!Responsibilities of ==Behavior==, ==ClassDescription== and ==Class==

==Behavior== provides the minimum state necessary for objects that have
instances, which includes a superclass link, a method dictionary and the class
format. The class format is an integer that encodes the pointer/non-pointer
distinction, compact/non-compact class distinction, and basic size of instances.
==Behavior== inherits from ==Object==, so it, and all of its subclasses, can
behave like objects.

==Behavior== is also the basic interface to the compiler. It provides methods
for creating a method dictionary, compiling methods, creating instances
(''i.e.'', ==new==, ==basicNew==, ==new:==, and ==basicNew:==), manipulating the
class hierarchy (''i.e.'',  ==superclass:==, ==addSubclass:==), accessing
methods (''i.e.'', ==selectors==, ==allSelectors==, ==compiledMethodAt:==),
accessing instances and variables (''i.e.'', ==allInstances==,
==instVarNames==...), accessing the class hierarchy (''i.e.'', ==superclass==,
==subclasses==) and querying (''i.e.'', ==hasMethods==, ==includesSelector==,
==canUnderstand:==, ==inheritsFrom:==, ==isVariable==).

==ClassDescription== is an abstract class that provides facilities needed by its
two direct subclasses, ==Class== and ==Metaclass==. ==ClassDescription== adds a
number of facilities to the base provided by ==Behavior==: named instance
variables, the categorization of methods into protocols, the maintenance of
change sets and the logging of changes, and most of the mechanisms needed for
filing out changes.

==Class== represents the common behaviour of all classes. It provides a class
name, compilation methods, method storage, and instance variables. It provides a
concrete representation for class variable names and shared pool variables
(==addClassVarName:==, ==addSharedPool:==, ==initialize==). Since a metaclass is
a class for its sole instance (''i.e.'', the non-meta class) and provides the
service for the instance as a class, all metaclasses ultimately inherit from
==Class==.

!!Every metaclass is an instance of ==Metaclass==

Metaclasses are objects too; they are instances of the class ==Metaclass== as
shown in Figure *@fig:metaclassclass*. The instances of class ==Metaclass== are
the anonymous metaclasses, each of which has exactly one instance, which is a
class.

+Every metaclass is a ==Metaclass==.>file://figures/TranslucentMetaclassClass.png|label=fig:metaclassclass+

==Metaclass== represents common metaclass behaviour. It provides methods for
instance creation (==subclassOf:==), creating initialized instances of the
metaclass's sole instance, initialization of class variables, metaclass
instance, method compilation, and class information (inheritance links,
instance variables, etc.).

!!The metaclass of ==Metaclass is an instance of ==Metaclass====

The final question to be answered is: what is the class of ==Metaclass class==?

The answer is simple: it is a metaclass, so it must be an instance of
==Metaclass==, just like all the other metaclasses in the system (see Figure
*@fig:metaclassclassclass*).

+All metaclasses are instances of the class ==Metaclass==, even the metaclass of ==Metaclass==.>file://figures/TranslucentMetaclassClassClass.png|label=fig:metaclassclassclass+

The figure shows how all metaclasses are instances of ==Metaclass==, including
the metaclass of ==Metaclass== itself. If you compare Figures
*@fig:metaclassclass* and *@fig:metaclassclassclass* you will see how the
metaclass hierarchy perfectly mirrors the class hierarchy, all the way up to
==Object class==.

The following examples show us how we can query the class hierarchy to
demonstrate that Figure *@fig:metaclassclassclass* is correct. (Actually, you
will see that we told a white lie â€” ==Object class superclass -\-> ProtoObject
class==, not ==Class==. In Pharo, we must go one superclass higher
to reach ==Class==.)

!!Chapter summary

This chapter gave an in-depth look into the uniform object model, and a
more thorough explanation of how classes are organized. If you get lost or
confused, you should always remember that message passing is the key: you look
for the method in the class of the receiver. This works on ''any'' receiver. If
the method is not found in the class of the receiver, it is looked up in its
superclasses.

-Every class is an instance of a metaclass. Metaclasses are implicit. A Metaclass is created automatically when you create the class that is its sole instance.
-The metaclass hierarchy parallels the class hierarchy. Method lookup for classes parallels method lookup for ordinary objects, and follows the metaclass's superclass chain.
-Every metaclass inherits from ==Class== and ==Behavior==. Every class ''is a'' ==Class==. Since metaclasses are classes too, they must also inherit from ==Class==. ==Behavior== provides behaviour common to all entities that have instances.
-Every metaclass is an instance of ==Metaclass==. ==ClassDescription== provides everything that is common to ==Class== and ==Metaclass==.
-The metaclass of ==Metaclass== is an instance of ==Metaclass==. The ''instance-of'' relation forms a closed loop, so ==Metaclass class class --> Metaclass==.
