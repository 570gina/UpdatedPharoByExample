###1\. Introduction

SUnit is a minimal yet powerful framework that supports the creation and deployment of tests\.
As might be guessed from its name, the design of SUnit focussed on *Unit Tests*, but in fact it can be used for integration tests and functional tests as well\.
Sunit was originally developed by Kent Beck and subsequently extended by Joseph Pelrine and others to incorporate the notion of a resource, which we will describe in Section 7\.6\.



The interest in testing and Test Driven Development is not limited to Pharo or Smalltalk\.
Automated testing has become a hallmark of the ind\{Agile software development\} movement, and any software developer concerned with improving software quality would do well to adopt it\.
Indeed, developers in many languages have come to appreciate the power of unit testing, and versions of
*xUnit* now exist for many languages, including Java, Python, Perl, \.Net and Oracle\.
This chapter describes SUnit 3\.3 \(the current version as of this writing\); the official web site of SUnit is
sunit\.sourceforge\.net, where updates can be found\.
