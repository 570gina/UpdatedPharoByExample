Doing a Pull Request
-----
Imagine that you want to fix a problem in the Morphic chapter. Here is the process: 

1. Click on this link.
https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/UpdatedPharoByExample/blob/master/Morphic/Morphic.pier
2. Click the <Fork> button in the top tight, then browse to "Morphic.pier" in your fork.
3. To the right of the <Raw/Blame/History> buttons, click the <Pencil> button to edit the file.
4. After editing, at the bottom select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"
and enter commit title, comment and new-branch-name to reflect your contribution. Click <Propose file change>
5. Now looking at "Open a pull request", this is issuing a PR to your own fork.  We need to change to the upstream fork.  At the top click
on "forked from SquareBracketAssociates/UpdatedPharoByExample" .
6. Under "Your recently pushed branches" click <Compare & pull request>
7. Check...
```
base fork: SquareBracketAssociates/UpdatedPharoByExample
base: master
head fork: YourName/UpdatedPharoByExample
compare: your new-branch-name
```
8. Review the diff, enter PR title and comment, then click <Create pull request>.
